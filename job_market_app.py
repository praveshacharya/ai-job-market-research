    1. **Connect a job-postings API** (e.g., Adzuna, Indeed, LinkedIn if you have access):
       - Replace `fetch_job_postings()` with a function that calls the API, paginates results, and returns job descriptions.
       - Store API keys in Streamlit secrets or environment variables.
    2. **Use an LLM for better summaries & skill extraction**:
       - Implement `summarize_with_llm()` to call Google AI Studio or OpenAI.
       - Be sure to handle rate limits and chunk long text.
    3. **Improve skill extraction**:
       - Replace keyword matching with spaCy named-entity recognition or a fine-tuned classifier.
    4. **Add trend analysis**:
       - Save analyzed results in a DB and allow time-series queries to show how demand changes over months.
